Microservices Project
This project is a sample implementation of a microservices architecture using Spring Boot. It includes three microservices - Order Management Service, Inventory Service, and Payment Service - that communicate with each other to fulfill orders in a hypothetical e-commerce system.

Microservices
Order Management Service
The Order Management Service is responsible for managing orders in the system. It exposes REST endpoints to create, update, and delete orders, and communicates with other services to fulfill these requests.

Inventory Service
The Inventory Service is responsible for managing the inventory of products in the system. It exposes REST endpoints to update the inventory, and communicates with other services to fulfill these requests.

Payment Service
The Payment Service is responsible for handling payments in the system. It exposes REST endpoints to process payments for orders, and communicates with other services to fulfill these requests.

Architecture
The microservices are designed to be loosely coupled and independently deployable. They communicate with each other using REST APIs and Kafka message broker. Service discovery is implemented using Eureka service registry. The API Gateway is implemented using Spring Cloud Gateway.

Technologies
The project is built using the following technologies:

Spring Boot
Spring Cloud Config
Eureka Service Registry
Spring Cloud Gateway
Hystrix Circuit Breaker
Turbine
Kafka
Prometheus
Grafana
